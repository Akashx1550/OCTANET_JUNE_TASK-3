# Twitter-Clone
This project is a fully responsive Twitter clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the core functionality and design of Twitter, providing users with a familiar and interactive experience. The clone consists of three main pages: the main page, the login page, and the news feed page.

## Features:

### Main Page
The main page serves as the landing page for the Twitter clone. It showcases a clean and intuitive user interface, designed using HTML and styled with CSS. Users can easily navigate to other pages, such as the login page or the news feed page, from this main page.

### Login Page
The login page allows users to authenticate and access their accounts. It provides a secure login process and verifies user credentials through JavaScript. Once logged in, users can access the news feed page.

### News Feed Page
The news feed page displays a stream of posts from users, resembling the timeline feature of Twitter. Users can scroll through posts, like, retweet and share them.The news feed page also includes a "Post" button that enables users to create their own posts, sharing their thoughts and updates with their network.

### Dark Mode Toggle
To enhance user experience and accommodate personal preferences, the Twitter clone includes a dark mode toggle icon. When activated, it switches the interface to a dark theme, reducing eye strain and providing a visually appealing alternative.
